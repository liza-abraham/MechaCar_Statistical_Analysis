## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

The statistcal study in this repository will analyze key metrics of concern to autoconsumers, in order to see how MechaCar measures up against its competition. Factors to be considered and analayzed include:

  - cost
  - city or highway fuel efficiency
  - horse power
  - maintenance cost
  - safety rating
 
 A linear regression model will be used to calculate MPG relative to other brands, and this will stand in for city/highway fuel efficency. 

The null hypothesis is that there will not be significant variation betwen MechaCar and cars with similar dimensions and engine specifications. 

The alternative hypothesis is that there will be variation even given similar horsepower and dimensions, depending torque, suspension, and other factors that can create drag. 

The data needed to run the test is quantified factors for suspension, torque, dimension, and fuel consumption.
